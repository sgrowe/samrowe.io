- Ensured high quality through over 86% unit test coverage using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), and end-to-end tests using [Detox](https://github.com/wix/Detox)
- Rapidly built and shipped new app features (such as a refer-a-friend competition) to grow the customer base over 300% in just four months
- Dramatically sped up our end-to-end tests in [CI](https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html), from roughly an hour to 20 minutes, by using [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache#readme) for distributed build caching
- Built a marketing website using [React](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), integrating Dato CMS for dynamic content management

### Tech Lead | [Multivitamin Studio](https://multivitamin.studio/)

Oct 2022 – July 2023

- Grew the capabilities of the development team by analysing and identifying skills gaps in the current team, mentoring existing engineers, and leading the interviewing and hiring of two additional engineers
- Built a sophisticated drone video streaming platform for [Skybound Rescuer](https://skyboundrescuerproject.com/) which allowed non-technical users to create a flight path for a drone in their web browser, and then view the real-time video stream from the drone as it then carried out this flight plan
  - Used [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/), [Redis](https://redis.io/) and microservices hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to allow users to control DJI drones remotely from the Skybound Rescuer web app
  - These services were deployed as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers onto a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster, with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) code used to provision the cluster

- Led development of [Troopr.co.uk](https://www.troopr.co.uk/), a comprehensive careers and events platform for military veterans, built using [React](https://react.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Resolved [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API performance issues for [The Racing Manager](https://theracingmanager.com/), reducing page load times for their biggest customers from over a minute to less than 5 seconds

  - The backend was deployed to [AWS ECS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html) as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container, and used [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to query an [Aurora Serverless PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) database.
  - Led the team developing the “briefing” feature, used for a critical phase of Levi’s product development lifecycle
  - Participated in user engagement sessions to refine product requirements
- Nando’s ID:
  - Carried out a major migration of all Nando’s user accounts from one identity provider to another to improve the uptime and security of all of Nando’s apps and web services
  - Developed high-performance REST and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) APIs in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to act as an interface in front of the existing identity provider, enabling us to switch identity provider without changing the interface exposed to other teams at Nando’s
  - Collaborated closely with teams across the organisation to that this transition was as low-risk and seamless as possible
  - Deployed using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Istio](https://istio.io/) service mesh
