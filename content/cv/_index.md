- Developed and deployed a sophisticated platform for remotely controlling and live-streaming video from DJI drones for Skybound Rescuer. This included exploration and testing of different combinations of video streaming technologies (such as HLS and HTTP-FLV) and server configurations to achieve the best possible latency and video quality in an economical way. The technology used for this complex platform included Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, Redis, MySQL, WebSockets, MQTT, Nginx and FFmpeg.
- Led a team to develop from scratch a career and events platform for military veterans. We were able to ship this project in just a few months and it is currently accessible at Troopr.co.uk. This platform was created using Next.js, Typescript, Postgres and integrated with Stripe for secure payments.
- Resolved major performance issues with The Racing Manager’s website and React Native mobile apps through a combination of profiling, improving SQL queries to fetch data in batches and avoid the N+1 query problem, GraphQL query improvements, and caching. This massively improved the user experience for large teams on key screens from several minutes of load time to under 10-15 seconds.
- Provided technical leadership for The Racing Manager on a roadmap for developing the next major iteration of the platform to help open it up to a wider audience. This was simultaneously balanced with necessary improvements and fixes to the existing platform.
- Led the development of multiple sites for SilverRail (such as Train over Plane) and the successful migration of their existing Wordpress website to a much more reliable React-based site using Sanity CMS as the backend. This helped dramatically improve site reliability, lowered maintenance costs and improved the authoring experience for new site content.
- Oversaw the integration of Freshsales CRM and Mews hospitality management system for Desert Springs to improve and simplify their existing business processes. This integration was built using TypeScript and AWS DynamoDB.
- I proactively identified current and future skills gaps in our team and addressed them by mentoring developers to improve their skills and experience, and additionally worked with upper management to hire new team members.

  - Collaborated with stakeholders to gather requirements and decide which features would best fit user needs during the "brief stage" of product line development
  - Led a spike exploring different free and paid data grid libraries to determine which would best fit user needs, and then we presented this information back to the client and discussed which tool we would use going forward
  - Participated in user engagement sessions to hear first-hand from users what the pain points of their current process are
  - Collaborated with UX and UI designers to break down work into user stories and tickets with clear acceptance criteria, with a focus on providing value to users
